ChIJQYL87YJZzpQRBP2sgHRkYDY,Positivo,0.4855151654411764,"When I went, they made me very uncomfortable, without any attention, misinformed about the menu. Finally, THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE, seriously, you need to try this."

ChIJ12JXXsdZzpQR5_Z3sxWaPJY,Positivo,0.4204915674603174,"The dish also takes some time and I feel that it still lacks a little organization in general. Rissotos with less flavor, sandwiches that don't have onions that taste like onions due to the lack of cleaning of the knives and dishes with less quantity or quality."

ChIJEcsFHuxbzpQRRsQLe-GPDu0,Positivo,0.3764267676767676,"Craft beer pubs should provide customers with water (and not sell it in bottles) this is basic, as a result, customers end up not buying water and the lack of it is extremely harmful. Water should be served in the same amount as beers, in all serious bars and they should provide customers with water at will (even more so where beer is already expensive enough to be able to distribute water without having to charge)."

A friend asked for dinner twice, it came below average, with so much history, the trade should improve the quality of the dishes, chicken fillet that was well-done turns raw, I'm friends with the owner, but when you move a chubby belly, it moves like a shake with everyone, I hope to come back and give a 5 and be able to comment on how much it has improved since the neighborhood trade we must give more value if it appreciates.
